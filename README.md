# Bridget Riley OP Art - v3

One of my graduate class assignment to recreate one of a English painter, Bridget Riley's optical art drawing. This was developed using canvas in Vanilla JavaScript. 

On a mobile device, when clicking the requesting permission button to grant the website access, the image will move based off the user's mobile device motions.

Put the Vanilla JavaScript into an Angular.js App and changes background color of the image every time page is load or reloads. Also implement an 3D cube from three.js into one the unused tabs.
